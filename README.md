# Board game test task
* Test task, was quite interesting for me, so I spent some time to make the better solution.
* All requirements for this task you can find in the [Docs/board-game.pdf](https://github.com/fonbrauzen/BoardGameTestTask/blob/master/BoardGameTestTaskApp/Docs/board-game.pdf)
* For now solution using greedy algorithm, but with current conditions - 6*6 and 3 colors seems optimal

## Installation
* .NET Core 2.1 console app
